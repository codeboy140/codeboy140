# You can read my Bio for more about me

I'm not currently working on anything public, but I do have some projects I'm working on. I'll releace them as soon as I feel ready

# Some things to keep in mind

- I'm new to Markdown

This is literaly my first markdown document ever, don't expect good formating

- I'm not a good coder

I code because I enjoy it, but I'm no Richard Stallman, expect lots of confusion from me as I try to wrap my head around code

- I'm Buisy

I have a lot of stuff takeing up my time, so don't expect an imediate response

- I'm a bad speller

If it wasn't obvius alredy, I rely a lot on spell check, spelling corrections apreciated
