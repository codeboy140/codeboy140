# You can read my Bio for more about me

I'm waiting for @epicgames to fix UE 5, it keeps crashing on startup. For now I use python and ocasionaly try noodling on UE 4

# Some things to keep in mind

- I'm new to Markdown

This is literaly my first markdown document ever, don't expect good formating

- I don't check my email often

I check my email if I'm alredy expecting something otherwise, don't expect an immediate response.-

- I'm not a good coder

I code because I enjoy it, but I'm no Richard Stallman, expect lots of confusion from me as I try to wrap my head around code
